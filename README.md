<h1>Hands-Free Food Ordering: A Gesture-Based Interface for Restaurants</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>

propose a gesture-based food ordering system to enhance the dinning experience for those with hearing impairments. The system works by the user navigating the food menu by raising gesture "5". To confirm
the order they raise a thump up, to cancel the raise a thump down.</p>
